The `SomaDataIO` R package loads and exports 'SomaScan' data via the
Standard BioTools, Inc. structured text file called an ADAT (`*.adat`).
The package also exports auxiliary functions for manipulating, wrangling,
and extracting relevant information from an ADAT object once in memory.
Basic familiarity with the R environment is assumed, as is the ability to install
contributed packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

If you run into any issues/problems with `SomaDataIO` full documentation
of the most recent
[release](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/releases)
can be found at our
[website of articles and workflows](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaDataIO/).
If the issue persists we encourage you to consult the
[issues](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/issues/)
page and, if appropriate, submit an issue and/or feature request.


---------------------


## Usage

The `SomaDataIO` package is licensed under the
[MIT](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
license and is intended solely for research use only (“RUO”) purposes.
The code contained herein may _not_ be used for diagnostic, clinical,
therapeutic, or other commercial purposes.


## Installation

The easiest way to install `SomaDataIO` is to install directly from CRAN:

```{r install-cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("SomaDataIO")
```

Alternatively from GitHub:

```{r install-gh, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("SomaLogic/SomaDataIO")
```

which installs the most current "development" version from the repository
`HEAD`. To install the _most recent_ release, use:

```{r install-release, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("SomaLogic/SomaDataIO@*release")
```

To install a *specific* tagged release, use:

```{r install-version, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("SomaLogic/SomaDataIO@v5.3.0")
```


#### Package Dependencies

The `SomaDataIO` package was intentionally developed to contain a
limited number of dependencies from CRAN. This makes
the package more stable to external software design changes but
also limits its contained feature set. With this in mind, `SomaDataIO`
aims to strike a balance providing long(er)-term stability and a
limited set of features.
Below are the package dependencies
(see also the [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/blob/main/DESCRIPTION)
file):

* [R (>= 4.1.0)](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [cli](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cli)
* [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)
* [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2)
* [lifecycle](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lifecycle)
* [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr)
* [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl)
* [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble)
* [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyr)


#### Biobase

The `Biobase` package is _suggested_, being required by only
two functions, `pivotExpressionSet()` and `adat2eSet()`.
[Biobase](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html)
must be installed separately from
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org)
by entering the following from the `R` Console:

```{r biobase, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("Biobase", version = remotes::bioc_version())
```

Information about Bioconductor can be found here:
[https://bioconductor.org/install/](https://bioconductor.org/install/)


#### Loading

Upon _successful_ installation, load `SomaDataIO` as normal:

```{r load-somadataio, eval = FALSE}
library(SomaDataIO)
```

For an index of available commands:
```{r help, eval = FALSE}
library(help = SomaDataIO)
```


---------------------


## Objects and Data

The `SomaDataIO` package comes with five (5) objects available
to users to run canned examples (or analyses). They can be accessed once
`SomaDataIO` has been attached via `library()`. They are:

* `example_data`: the original 'SomaScan' file (`example_data.adat`) can
  be found [here](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaLogic-Data) or downloaded
  directly via:
  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomaLogic/SomaLogic-Data/main/example_data.adat
  ```
  - within `SomaDataIO` it has been replaced by an abbreviated,
    light-weight version containing only the first 10 samples:
    ```r
    dir(system.file("extdata", package = "SomaDataIO"), full.names = TRUE)
    ```
* `ex_analytes`: the analyte (feature) variables in `example_data`
* `ex_anno_tbl`: the annotations table associated with `example_data`
* `ex_target_names`: a mapping object for analyte -> target
* `ex_clin_data`: a table containing variables `SampleId`, `smoking_status` and
  `alcohol_use` to demonstrate merging clinical sample annotation information
  to a `soma_adat` object
* See also `?SomaScanObjects`


---------------------


## Main (I/O) Features 

* Loading data (Import)
    + parse and import a `*.adat` text file into an `R` session
      as a `soma_adat` object.

* Wrangling data (manipulation)
    + subset, reorder, and list various fields of a `soma_adat` object.
    + `?SeqId` analyte (feature) matching.
    + [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) verb
      S3 methods for the `soma_adat` class.
    + `?rownames` helpers that do not break `soma_adat` attributes.
    + please see the article [Loading and Wrangling 'SomaScan'](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaDataIO/articles/tips-loading-and-wrangling.html)

* Exporting data (Output)
    + write out a `soma_adat` object as a `*.adat` text file.


## Loading an ADAT

Loading an ADAT text file is simple using `read_adat()`:

```{r read-adat}
# Note: This `system.file()` command returns a filepath to the `example_data10` 
# object in the `SomaDataIO` package
adat_path <- system.file("extdata", "example_data10.adat",
                         package = "SomaDataIO", mustWork = TRUE)
adat_path

# `adat_path` should be the elaborated path and file name of the *.adat file to
# be loaded into the R workspace from your local file system
# (e.g. adat_path = "PATH_TO_ADAT/my_adat.adat")
my_adat <- read_adat(file = adat_path)

# test object class
is.soma_adat(my_adat)

# S3 print method (forwards -> tibble)
my_adat
```

Please see the article [Loading and Wrangling SomaScan](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaDataIO/articles/tips-loading-and-wrangling.html)
for more details and options.


## Wrangling

The `soma_adat` class comes with numerous class-specific
S3 methods to the most popular
[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and
[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) generics.

```{r methods}
# see full complement of `soma_adat` methods
methods(class = "soma_adat")
```

#### Merging Sample Annotation Data

The `example_data` object includes some sample annotation data built-in, with
the variables `Age` and `Sex` included for clinical samples, but in practice 
ADAT files generally do not have any clinical or sample annotation data fields
included.

To merge sample annotation data into an existing `soma_adat` class object,
use the `left_join()` method.  Here, joining the `ex_clin_data` object adds in
two additional clinical variables, `smoking_status` and `alcohol_use`:

```{r merge-annotations}
# `clin_path` should be the elaborated path and file name of the *.csv or
# similar file to be loaded into the R workspace from your local file system
# (e.g. clin_path = "PATH_TO_CLIN/clin_data.csv")
# clin_data <- readr::read_csv(clin_path)

merged_adat <- my_adat |> 
  dplyr::left_join(ex_clin_data, by = "SampleId") 

merged_adat |> 
  dplyr::select(SampleId, Age, Sex, smoking_status, alcohol_use) |> 
  head(n = 3)
```

Please see the article [Loading and Wrangling SomaScan](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaDataIO/articles/tips-loading-and-wrangling.html)
for more details about available `soma_adat` methods.


## ADAT structure

The `soma_adat` object also contains specific structure that are useful
to users. Please also see `?colmeta` or `?annotations` for further
details about these fields.
