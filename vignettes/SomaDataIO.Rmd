This document accompanies the `SomaDataIO` R package, which loads
and exports 'SomaScan' data via the SomaLogic Operating Co., Inc.
structured text file called an ADAT (`*.adat`).
For file format see
[here](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaLogic-Data/blob/master/README.md).
The package also exports auxiliary functions for manipulating, wrangling,
and extracting relevant information from an ADAT object once in memory.
Basic familiarity with the R environment is assumed, as is the ability to install
contributed packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).


-------------------


## Main Features (I/O)

* Loading data (Import)
    + parse and import a `*.adat` text file into an `R` session
      as a `soma_adat` object.

* Wrangling data (manipulation)
    + subset, reorder, and list various fields of a `soma_adat` object.
    + `?SeqId` analyte (feature) matching.
    + [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) verb
      S3 methods for the `soma_adat` class.
    + `?rownames` helpers that do not break `soma_adat` attributes.
    + please see vignette `vignette("tips-loading-and-wrangling", package = "SomaDataIO")`

* Exporting data (Output)
    + write out a `soma_adat` object as a `*.adat` text file.

## Workflows and Analysis

This section will become more fleshed out in future versions of
`SomaDataIO`. In the meantime, below are 4 examples of typical
primary statistical analyses that are commonly performed on
'SomaScan' data:

- Two-group comparison (e.g. differential expression) via *t*-test
  + see `stats::t.test()`
  + see vignette `vignette("stat-two-group-comparison", package = "SomaDataIO")`

- Multi-group comparison (e.g. differential expression) via ANOVA
  + see `stats::aov()`
  + see vignette `vignette("stat-three-group-analysis-anova", package = "SomaDataIO")`

- Binary classification
  + see `stats::glm()`
  + see vignette `vignette("stat-binary-classification", package = "SomaDataIO")`

- Linear regression
  + see `stats::lm()`
  + see vignette `vignette("stat-linear-regression", package = "SomaDataIO")`
