This document accompanies the `SomaDataIO` R package, which loads
and exports 'SomaScan' data via the SomaLogic Operating Co., Inc.
proprietary text file called an ADAT (`*.adat`).
For file format see [here](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaLogic-Data/blob/master/README.md).
The package also exports auxiliary functions for manipulating, wrangling,
and extracting relevant information from an ADAT object once in memory.
Basic familiarity with the R environment is assumed, as is the ability to install
contributed packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).



-------------------


## Main Features (I/O)

* Loading data (Import)
    + parse and import a `*.adat` text file into an `R` session
      as a `soma_adat` object.

* Wrangling data (manipulation)
    + subset, reorder, and list various fields of a `soma_adat` object.
    + `?SeqId` analyte (feature) matching.
    + `dplyr` and `tidyr` verb S3 methods for the `soma_adat` class.
    + `?rownames` helpers that do not break `soma_adat` attributes.

* Exporting data (Output)
    + write out a `soma_adat` object as a `*.adat` text file.


----------------------

## Workflows and Analysis (TODO)
This section will become more fleshed out in future versions of
`SomaDataIO`

#### In the meantime please see the package
