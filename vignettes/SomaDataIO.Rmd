This document accompanies the `SomaDataIO` R package, which loads
and exports 'SomaScan' data via the SomaLogic Operating Co., Inc.
proprietary text file called an ADAT (`*.adat`).
The package also exports auxiliary functions for manipulating, wrangling,
and extracting relevant information from an ADAT object once in memory.
Basic familiarity with the R environment is assumed, as is the ability to install
contributed packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).



-------------------


## Main Features (I/O)

* Loading data (Import)
  + Import a text file in the `*.adat` format into an `R` session
    as a `soma_adat` object.
* Wrangling data (manipulation)
  + Subset, reorder, and list various fields of a `soma_adat` object.
* Exporting data (Output)
  + Write out a `soma_adat` object as a `*.adat` text file.


----------------------

## TODO: Complete Later

#### In the meantime see [README](README.md)
