\describe{
\item{example_data}{a \code{soma_adat} parsed via \code{\link[=read_adat]{read_adat()}} containing
192 samples (see below for breakdown of sample type). There are 5318
columns containing 5284 analyte features and 34 clinical meta data fields.
These data have been pre-processed via the following steps:
\itemize{
\item hybridization normalized (all samples)
\item calibrators and buffers median normalized
\item plate scaled
\item calibrated
\item Adaptive Normalization by Maximum Likelihood (ANML) of
QC and clinical samples
}
\strong{Note1:} The \code{Age} and \code{Sex} (\code{M}/\code{F}) fields contain simulated values
designed to contain biological signal.

\strong{Note2:} The \code{SampleType} column contains sample source/type information
and usually the \code{SampleType == Sample} represents the "client" samples.
}

\item{ex_analytes}{character string of the analyte features contained
in the \code{soma_adat} object, derived from a call to \code{\link[=getAnalytes]{getAnalytes()}}.}

\item{ex_anno_tbl}{a lookup table corresponding to a
transposed data frame of the "Col.Meta" attribute of an ADAT, with an
index key field \code{AptName} included in column 1, derived from a call to
\code{\link[=getAnalyteInfo]{getAnalyteInfo()}}.}

\item{ex_target_names}{A lookup table mapping \code{SeqId} feature names ->
target names contained in \code{example_data}. This object (or one like it) is
convenient at the console via auto-complete for labeling and/or creating
plot titles on the fly.}

\description{
The \code{example_data} object is intended to provide existing and prospective
SomaLogic customers with example data to enable analysis preparation prior
to receipt of SomaScan data, and also for those generally curious about the
SomaScan data deliverable. It is \strong{not} intended to be used as a control
group for studies or provide any metrics for SomaScan data in general.
}
\section{Data Description}{

The \code{example_data} object contains a SomaScan V4 study from healthy
normal individuals. The RFU measurements themselves and other identifiers
have been altered to protect personally identifiable information (PII),
but also retain underlying biological signal as much as possible.
There are 192 total EDTA-plasma samples across two 96-well plate runs
which are broken down by the following types:
\itemize{
\item 170 clinical samples (client study samples)
\item 10 calibrators (replicate controls for combining data across runs)
\item 6 QC samples (replicate controls used to assess run quality)
\item 6 Buffer samples (no protein controls)
}
}

\section{Data Processing}{

The standard V4 data normalization procedure for EDTA-plasma samples was
applied to this dataset. For more details on the data standardization process
see the Data Standardization and File Specification Technical Note. General
details are outlined above.
