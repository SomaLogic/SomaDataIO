# Getting help with SomaDataIO

Thanks for using SomaDataIO!

Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to
put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

If we can’t reproduce the bug, we can’t fix it! Start by making a
minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven’t heard of
or used `reprex` before, you’re in for a treat! Seriously, `reprex` will
make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is an
excellent ROI for the five to ten minutes it’ll take you to learn what
it’s all about). For additional `reprex` pointers, check out the [Get
help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/).

## Where to ask?

Armed with your `reprex`, the next step is to figure out [where to
ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask).

- If it’s a `R` related question: start with
  [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/) and/or
  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). There are more people
  there to answer questions.

- If it’s a bug with
  [SomaDataIO](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/): you’re in the
  right place; please [file an
  issue](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/issues/new).

- If you’re not sure: let the community help you figure it out! If your
  problem *is* a bug or a feature request, you can easily return
  [here](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/issues/) and report it.

- For *non*-coding related feedback or inquiries please reach out to
  <techsupport@somalogic.com>.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/SomaLogic/SomaDataIO/issues/) to make sure
the bug hasn’t been reported and/or already fixed in the development
version. By default, the search will be pre-populated with
`is:issue is:open`. You can [edit the
qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/),
`is:pr`, `is:closed`, etc., as needed, e.g. you’d simply remove
`is:open` to search *all* issues in the repo, open or closed.

## What happens next?

We aim to respond to questions or simple bugs within 24 - 48h,
particularly questions accompanied by a `reprex` can typically be
addressed quickly. More complex bugs or feature requests can take
longer, as they require a deeper discussion regarding the software
development lifecycle of `SomaDataIO`. As mentioned above, you may
always reach out to our Global Scientific Engagement team at
<techsupport@somalogic.com> or for more general inquiries at
<support@somalogic.com>.
