## Checks
- [ ] Please search previous issues before creating a new one,
  to ensure yours is not a duplicate. You can
  [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/),
  `is:pr`, `is:closed`, etc., as needed, e.g. you'd simply remove `is:open` to
  search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

- [ ] Please include a minimal REProducible EXample (AKA a `reprex`)


## Reprex
If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/),
please start by reading
[**repr**oducible **ex**ample](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).
You might need to install these packages:

 ```r
 install.packages(c("reprex", "sessioninfo"), repos = "http://cran.r-project.org")
 ```
