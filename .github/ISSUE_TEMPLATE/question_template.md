- Please search previous issues before creating a new one,
  to ensure yours is not a duplicate. You can
  [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/),
  `is:pr`, `is:closed`, etc., as needed, e.g. you'd simply remove `is:open` to
  search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
